Wordpress migration to a new host and a new domain is tricky!

To move a problematic site I used [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) a plugin that did all the heavy lifting of changing the configuration settings, fix the db serialized strings, apply some legacy conversion to the queries and other stuff.

Without the plugin a manual migration was almost impossible.

Kudos to the authors.
