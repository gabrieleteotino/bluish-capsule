Pingendo features a super simple drag and drop interface, with a rich library of prebuilt elements that lets you create web pages with ease.

It produces just plain HTML, SASS and CSS to keep things simple, fully customizable and easely integrable with Javascript.

I played with [Pingendo](https://pingendo.com) a bit and it is a bit confusing, but after a few minutes you have a web page. You can fiddle with the IDE and the source code in parallel.

The free version have ~~a easly removable~~ branding and is only for non commercial use. The paid version is $99, a bit high for the tool quality but easily affordable if you use it everyday.
