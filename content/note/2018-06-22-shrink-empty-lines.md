Syntactic line compression enables you to make better use of your screen's vertical real-estate.

<!--more-->

This [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.SyntacticLineCompression) shrinks lines that contain neither letters nor numbers by 25% vertically, allowing more lines to be displayed in the editor. Other lines are not affected. Can shrink lines that contain braces.

Note how the empty lines and the lines containing only braces are slightly smaller. Not by a lot but enough to give a few more lines of visibility for your code and reduce scrolling.
