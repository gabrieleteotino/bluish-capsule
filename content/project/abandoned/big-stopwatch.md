*This project is discontinued and not available on the play store*

A fully featured stopwatch with big buttons.

When you are taking times you can focus on the thing you are timing and don't look at the buttons on the screen.

You can easily switch from left to right handed mode.

Each session is automatically recorded, so you can't accidentally loose data.

For each session you can view the total time, the best lap, the average lap and a detailed list of the laps.
