DatingApp is a SPA dating application written in Angular 5 with a webapi backend made in C# using .net core 2.1.

The application is my opinionated version of this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/)

The course used a previous version of .net core I fixed everything to use 2.1.0-rc1-final. After chapter 5 I also gained enough confidence with Angular to update it to version 6.
