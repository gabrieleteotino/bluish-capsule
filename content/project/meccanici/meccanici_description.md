Meccanici is a service dedicated to explore modern application technologies.

The service is dedicated to a semi-real world problem: the managment of veichle repairs and maintenance. Each user can be a Mechanic and a Vehicle Owner.
Veichles (cars, motorbikes, trucks and so on) have a complex story of self made and professional maintenance. This history can be shared between all the users to view what other operators have previously made and have all the information needed to do the best possible job.

# Story time
Oreste buys a new car: a Fiat Panda.

He register a new account to Meccanici and adds his new car to his owned vehicles, then the application suggest him to set the default reminders for the planned manintenance and he adds a new remainder to take the car for a check in 6 months.

After 6 months he takes the car to the official Fiat Store, they do the following:
- change oil
- change oil filter

But the official Fiat store is not using Meccanici (yet), so Oreste open his page and mark the operation done to the car in his history. He can also put some attachment like the pdf file he received via email from the Fiat Store and a jpg of the paper receipit.

After a few months Oreste has a small accident. No one was injured but the car needs a paint job and some new parts. This time he go to a body shop near his workplace: F.lli Carrozzi.

F.lli Carrozzi is a registered maintenance shop, nice! Oreste is received by Mario Carrozzi which ask for his email address to input in Meccanici. The application immediately send a notification to  Oreste and he use his smartphone to confirm that he is at F.lli Carrozzi shop and give them access to the records of his Fiat Panda. In a few seconds Mario receives all the data about the Fiat Panda, included model and serial numbers.

Mario takes a look at the damage and takes a few photos and notes using the mobile version of Meccanici. The car is stored in a private parking space waiting to be fixed. Oreste goes home.

In the following days F.lli Carrozzi do a paint job on the car, order a few parts and put them in the car in place of the broken ones. When the job is finished he takes a picture of the car and send it to Oreste.

Oreste view the nice work done on his car and as soon as he gets out of the office he goes to take his car back.

He pays for the service and the bill is sent to him using Meccanici.

F.lli Carrozzi tells Oreste to come back in a month to check that everything is ok, an appointment id made and a remainder is set in Meccanici.

After a month Oreste goes back for the check up and Mario Carrozzi takes a look in Meccanici to recall what he have done to the car and what is he going to check. He does the check-up and writes a note that everithing is ok.
